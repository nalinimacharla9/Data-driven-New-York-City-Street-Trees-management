# Data-driven-New-York-City-Street-Trees-management
2015 NYC Street Tree Census Dataset has 683788 records with 45 attributes Surveyed and collected by the Volunteers, Staff, and Organizations. This dataset consists of information regarding the Street Trees and attributes. We will be using a couple of correlations among various attributes to address the business problems and improve the green ecosystem in the city accordingly. In this, every Tree is a single Data point, and each Tree is necessary to play a vital role for Dashboarding and Analysis. We have built an Interactive Dashboard using Tableau and R Shiny.
